1. I use a function for messages because it needs to be able to return the value, and it doesn't cause
   changes to the state of the api in the background (Twilio). I use an action for the send SMS because
   it does change the state in the server (adding a message), and it doesn't need to return anything.
2. Putting the secrets directly in the module is not how it should ever be one, because secrets need to
   be guarded and they will also be different for different users in many cases. By using the "with" clause
   and making each user enter the secrets, they act as credentials for those who would use the api.
