1. the collect_temperatures rule happens whenever a new temperature comes along, and it adds it to the entity variable temperatures. The temperatures function then lets other rules access that entity variable

2. I simply used the filter operator over the temperatures array, only letting values under the threshold through

3. temperatures is only used within this ruleset, so it should do nothing if removed

4. outside events could not get the list of temperatures if it is not listed on shares
